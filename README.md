# DATA Varuna Validation Service Client

DATA Varuna is a product from the Governikus GmbH & Co. KG Bremen. It includes
a webservice with a REST API that can be used to validate the signatures of
documents. This sample project demonstrates how to use KeyCloak to get the
required token to access the Validation Service.
